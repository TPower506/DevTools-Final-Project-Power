Mt. Fuji:: 

Mt. Fuji is an active volcano located on the border of Yamanashi and Shizuoka prefecture on Honshu Island.
There are many places by the base of the mountain where you can stay to gaze upon the mountain but it depends on cloud visibility.
Nevertheless, this is a must visit for those in Japan who enjoy looking at natural wonders.

Takachiho Gorge::

Takachiho Gorge is located in the Miyazaki prefecture and is a must see for those who can't get enough of natural, scenic places.
Visitors can either rent a boat and row down a river up to a waterfall, or walk on a path.
The area is absolutely stunning, and just another natural wonder that Japan has to offer.
